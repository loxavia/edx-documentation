.. _Checking Student Progress and Issuing Certificates:

###################################################
Assign Final Grades and Issue Certificates
###################################################
.. This chapter will be renamed and expanded to include course wrap-up activities and best practices.

As you prepare for the end of your course, you can send students a :ref:`course
farewell<Course Farewell and Certificates>` email message.

To assign a final grade to each student enrolled in a course, you generate
grades after the **Course End Date** and **Time** have passed. See
:ref:`Access_grades`.
 
The final grades of a student in the course and the grading configuration you
set in Studio are used to determine whether the student has earned a Certificate
of Mastery for the course.

The process of issuing certificates is completed at edX: work with your edX
program manager to schedule a date to issue certificates and complete this
process.

****************************************
Student-Generated Certificates
****************************************

If you have a self-paced course, you can allow your students to download their
certificates as soon as they have completed enough of the course with a high
enough grade to qualify for a certificate. For these courses, you work with
edX to create a certificate template, and then you enable student-generated
certificates on the Instructor Dashboard. Learners request certificates from
the course **Progress** page, the system generates a certificate based on the
template that you have created, and learners can then download their
certificates from the **Progress** page or from their dashboard.

.. note:: If your course offers student-generated certificates, we encourage you 
 to include this information on your course About page, on the **Course Info**
 page in the LMS, and in communication with your learners.

Learners can request a certificate at any time after they qualify. Learners
may want to request a certificate right away, or they may wait until they have
completed the course. For more information, see (link to SFD Learner Requested
Certificates).

===================================================
Enable Student-Generated Certificates
===================================================

You must work with edX to create a certificate for your course before you enable
student-generated certificates.

#. On the Instructor Dashboard, select the **Certificates** tab. Note that you
   only see this tab if your course offers student-generated certificates.
#. Under **Example Certificates**, select **Generate Example Certificates** to
   create example honor code and verified certificates for your course.

   This step may take a few moments. If the page does not update
   automatically, click **Refresh Status**.

#. Under **Status**, select **View verified certificate** and **View honor
   code certificate** to make sure that the certificates look the way that you
   want them to look.
#. After you have verified that your certificates are correct, select **Enable
   Student-Generated Certificates** under **Student-Generated Certificates**.
#. In the confirmation dialog box that opens, click **OK**.

After you enable student-generated certificates, students receive a message on
their **Progress** page when they qualify for a certificate. They can then
request and download their own certificates. For more information, see (link
to SFD Learner Requested Certificates).
