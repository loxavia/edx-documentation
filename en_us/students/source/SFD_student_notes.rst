In some edX courses, you can use the Student Notes feature to highlight and make
notes about what you read right in the body of the course. You can see
individual notes inside the course content, or you can see all of your notes at
once on the **Notes** tab.

 videos, or PDF textbooks.

When a course includes student notes, every page has a **Notes** tab at the top
and a pencil icon in the lower-right corner.

.. note:: Learners who do not use a mouse can use keyboard shortcuts to create, 
 access, and delete notes. For more information about using keyboard
 shortcuts, see :ref:`SFD SN Keyboard Shortcuts`.
